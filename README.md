### Home Assistant TV Dashboard
The Home Assistant TV Dashboard companion app started life as an app to simply display a preview of video doorbell or webcam, over time it grew into a fully fledged app that can also multi-live video streams and a Home Assistant dashboard.

The notifications are in the global scope of your Android TV device. They will be displayed regardless of which application is running.
